This is a project so I have a local and easy-to-retrieve note library. The front end is in react (so loadable in the browser) and backend is in golang and the backend is a REST API (and http server) written in golang. The settings are stored in `*.json` and the actual notes are stored in `*.html` (will be `*.md` eventually).

The notes format support markdown and are organized into a tree.

# TODO

* still need to save files as *.md instead of *.html
